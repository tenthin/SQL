What is a Relational Database?
A relational database refers to the database type that stores a collection of data items having pre-defined relationships. This database adopts the relational model, representing data as a set of tables with columns and rows. 
In a relational database, each column within a table contains specific data and a field that stores an attribute’s real value.
On the other hand, the rows within a table contain a collection of a particular object’s related values. 
Each row has a unique identifier known as the primary key. You can access the stored data without needing to reorganize the tables. 

SQL:
SQL is a type of language that can be used to utilize your database. It is a base language for databases like MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle etc. 
SQL stands for Structure Query Language and it can be used to utilize the relational database management system.
This can also be used for accessing, manipulating and updating data in the database using some commands. 
The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) maintains that SQL is the standard language for managing a relational database management system, such as MySQL. 
It is owned, hosted, maintained, and offered by Microsoft. 

MySQL:
MySQL is a relational database management system that utilizes the SQL command.
MySQL was developed way back in 1995 by MySQL AB. However, now it is owned and offered by Oracle Corporation. 
MySQL is an open-source relational database management system that uses SQL commands to perform specific functions/operations in a database. 

*SQL is a query language, whereas MySQL is a relational database that uses SQL to query a database.
*SQL is used for writing queries for databases, MySQL facilitates data storing, modifying, and management in a tabular format.

ddl: create, alter, drop, truncate(Data definition Language)
dql: SELECT (data query Language)
dml: insert,update, delete (data manipulation language)
dcl: grant, revoke (data control language) {not that important to know completely, but know the basic theory}


Examples of TCL commands:

    COMMIT– commits a Transaction.
    ROLLBACK– rollbacks a transaction in case of any error occurs.
