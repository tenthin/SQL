/* 1. What do you mean by a database, relational database, SQL, tuple, stored procedure, Primary key, foreign key, DDL, DML and 
what is the difference between WHERE and HAVING clause? (Please do not refer to internet or notes to get the definition)

2. Create a new table 'Lhadey' with attributes (Name, Age, Gender, DOB, weight, height). (all column data types has to be different)
but height and weight has to be same datatype. Assign a default value to weight column.
Next, Populate the table with 5 records, dont give value to weight column (one of the record's height value has to be 175.5 and one to be 156.2)
Then, drop the column 'weight'.
Next, update the height column value to 143.2 and age to 56 where height value is 175.5.
Next, Delete all the record for which height is 156.2.
Finally drop the whole table.
